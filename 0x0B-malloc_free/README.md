 Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
 The woman who has no imagination has no wings
 He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
 If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
 If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
 It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe
I will show you how great I am
